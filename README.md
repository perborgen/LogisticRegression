# LogisticRegression
Logistic regression from scratch in Python

Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take only discrete values for given set of features(or inputs), X.

This example uses gradient descent optimization algorithm to train the model. It also contains the logistic regression implementation using Scikit-learn library.This will help us compare the two implementations.
